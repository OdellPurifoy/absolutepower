# Absolutepower
A web site created for my local, privately owned gym

## Details
1. Utilized HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 3 to build the site.
2. I chose to use a single page layout to keep the site clean and easy to navigate. Also because the gym itself isn't extremely elaborate, so I took care to match the actual gyms' features with the look of the site.
3. Used Google fonts for the the headings.
4. Included a carousel to display the images of the facility.
5. Embedded the current class schedule.
6. Lastly, I incorporated a simple footer which links to the two social media platforms used by Absolute Power.
