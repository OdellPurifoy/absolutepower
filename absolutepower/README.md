# absolutepower
The Absolute Power website was created for my local gym. The goal of the page was to be clean, clear and simple. 
-Uses the Bootstrap framework.
-Single page layout.
-Includes a carousel for easy viewing of the gyms pictures. 

This site is great for a small business like my local gym as it gives the customer a clear idea of what the gym offers in a single, easy to
navigate page.
